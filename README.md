# This is the old RYO project, please see the new version
This old project are kinda like a buffer for my daily pieces code. 
While it is helpful if I just copy and paste some of the code snippets
into my new project, it generally become a nightmare if I want to
build a larger and complete system on this old RYO project. 

So I started to write and migrate from this old RYO project. 

See li-yiyang/ryo for new one and this will remain as li-yiyang/ryo-old.
